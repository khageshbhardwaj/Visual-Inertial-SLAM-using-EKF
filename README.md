# Visual-Inertial-SLAM-using-EKF
The project entails developing a Visual-Inertial SLAM algorithm by integrating IMU data and visual feature observations 
from stereo-camera images.
It comprises three main parts.

# part 1
Implementing an EKF prediction step using IMU measurements to estimate the IMU's pose over time. This part of the program 
generates a plot for an estimated pose trajectory over time.

# part 2
Incorporating an EKF update step for landmark mapping with visual features extracted from the camera images.


# part 3
and integrating these steps to create a cohesive algorithm for real-time pose estimation and landmark mapping. This integration aims to improve the accuracy and robustness of localization and mapping in dynamic environments, with potential applications in robotics, autonomous navigation, and augmented reality.
