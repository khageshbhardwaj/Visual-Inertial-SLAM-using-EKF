# To run the code
we need only two files given in code folder, main.py and pr3utils.py

1. main.py contains all the code for part a, b and c.
2. pr3_utils.py contains all the requied functions referenced from main.py.

a. Run main.py and it will run through and generate the required plots. 
b. Keep the code in the code folder, else provide approapriate path.
c. Change the dataset number to access another dataset.

# import them before running the code
***for main.py

import numpy as np
from tqdm import tqdm
from pr3_utils import *

***for pr3_utils.py

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from transforms3d.euler import mat2euler
